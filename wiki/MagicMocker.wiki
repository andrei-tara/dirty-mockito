= Mockito straight up =

If you just want a little convenience with mocking objects using Mockito, then just use the `MagicMocker` rule.

{{{
public class UsesMockResourceTest {

  @Rule
  public MagicMocker magicMocker = new MagicMocker();

  @Mock
  private Resource mockResource;

  @Test
  public void testUseResource() {
    UsesResource usesResource = new UsesResource();
    usesResource.setResource(mockResource);
    usesResource.useResource();

    assertTrue(mockResource.isUsed());

    verify(mockResource).use();
  }
}}}

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* As of JUnit 4.7, `@Before` methods execute _before_ `@Rule`s, hence, any `@Mock`s initialized by `MagicMocker` will be unavailable in a test's `@Before` methods. JUnit 4.8 will execute rules before `@Before` methods and will make it possible to move initialization of `UsesResource` into a `@Before` method.
